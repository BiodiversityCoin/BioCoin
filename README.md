A design for a cryptocurrency for the benefit of nature conservation-restoration

This project describes the foundation and the protocol involved in creating a cryptocurrency for financing nature conservation and restoration projects. It provides a Return on Investment (ROI) to a host of investors, ranging from small investors to environmental NGOs and conservation groups to crowd funding and financial investors. The latter are usually involved in financing practices that that detrimental to Nature through the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources which are considered free and limitless. Their costs due to damages cause to biodiversity and ecosystems however are not priced in in prices but treated as externalities. These externalities at one point in time need to be accounted and paid for and usually by others in society.
Investing in Nature conservation and restoration does not offer a timely and high enough ROI for financial institutions and other investors. They profer short term profit over long term interest. The cryptocurrency described in this project will make investing into Nature more attractive by offering a better ROI while making the currency a potential secondary investment tool by offering an opportunity for growth.
